# Personal Restaurant Guide

## Our project is meant for users that want to keep a personal record of the restaurants they visited, rate them, and share their experience using email (Facebook or twitter). The problem this app will solve is to be able to keep users more organized and track down restaurants they’ve been to, and it’ll allow users to keep a list to see whether the place they plan on going to is a new experience for them. How the app will solve this problem is it’ll store the restaurants that you’ve been to with the rating that you gave it along with search capabilities (search bar). If users want to click on a specific restaurant, it will bring them to a details screen providing them with more information about the restaurant.
